# Project Description
Our project is a server and client based shared playlist. This project aims to allow users at a party or similar event with many people to vote for songs on a shared group playlist. The music that is voted highest will be put at the top of a playlist that is shared by all users. Users will also have access to their own music library (similar to the music library created in project 0), which other users cannot alter.
